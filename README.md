## Project Overview

The Badly Described Film quiz is a website that aims to provide entertainment and a fun challenge to the user with a quiz game. It is a fun way to look at well established movies and tests even the biggest film buffs knowledge. This site has been created as part of my Portfolio Project 2 for the Code institute.
