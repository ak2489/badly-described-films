## Project Overview

The Badly Described Film quiz is a website that aims to provide entertainment and a fun challenge to the user with a quiz game. It is a fun way to look at well established films and tests even the biggest film buffs knowledge. This site has been created as part of my Portfolio Project 2 for the Code institute.

## Features

### Start up

* Loading up the Quiz you can see a simple layout with a background image used from royalty free website [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/). In the game area you can see the title using the font 'Bangers' from [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/?category=Display) and logo from [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/). The tag line under the title gives the user a clue as to what the quiz is about and a start button.

### Question Area

* After clicking start the first question loads up with 4 possible answers each one in their own button. The user can see this is now a multiple choice quiz and has an option of 4 answers to chose from. When the user hovers a mouse over the answers the background colour of the button changes. There are 10 questions in total they load up in a random order every time the quiz is started.

### Answer Area

* Upon selecting an answer the background colour of the buttons changes to show the user the right and wrong answers. Right being shown by green and wrong being shown by red. It also loads up a next button to go to the next question.

### End of Quiz

* After the 10 questions have cycled through a propmt comes up to say you have finished the quiz and instructs the user to click restart to try again.

### Additional Features

* The colour scheme was chosen from [MyColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/) and was picked based on the dark navy colour used in the background image. 

### Features Left to Implment

* I would have like to have implemented a score counter to the game so the user can see how they are doing.
